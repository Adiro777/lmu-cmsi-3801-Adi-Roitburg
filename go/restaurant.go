// A little utility that simulates performing a task for a random duration.
// For example, calling do(10, "Remy", "is cooking") will compute a random
// number of milliseconds between 5000 and 10000, log "Remy is cooking",
// and sleep the current goroutine for that much time.

func do(seconds int, action ...any) {
    log.Println(action...)
    randomMillis := 500 * seconds + rand.Intn(500 * seconds)
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(randomMillis) * time.Millisecond)
}

// Implement the rest of the simulation here. You may need to add more imports
// above.
