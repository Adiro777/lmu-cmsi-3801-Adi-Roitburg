Fork this repo for your homework submissions. After forking, please replace the contents of this readme file with information about your submission, including the name(s) of the students and any notes you need to leave for the graders.

Your homework submissions will consist of programs in the following folders:

- Homework 1: Lua, Python, JavaScript
- Homework 2: OCaml, Haskell, TypeScript
- Homework 3: Java, Kotlin, Swift
- Homework 4: C, C++, Rust
- Homework 5: Go, Gleam, Mojo

At each homework deadline, the graders will clone your repo and run the tests. I will be inspecting the source code, grading your work on style, clarity, and appropriate use of language idioms. Do not throw away points in this area: **use a code formatter and a linter**. Please consider it a moral obligation to use these tools. Not doing so is a violation of professional ethics. _You must respect the naming, capitalization, formatting, spacing, and indentation conventions of each language_.

The test files are included in the repo already. They are available for YOU! They will help you not only learn the languages and concepts covered in this course, but to help you with professional practice. You should get accustomed to writing code to make tests pass. As you grow in your profession, you will get used to writing your tests early.

The test suites are run like so:

Lua

```
lua test.lua
```

Python

```
python3 test.py
```
